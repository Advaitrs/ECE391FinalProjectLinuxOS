# Please Do NOT copy code!!!!

Worked with Nikita Vasilyev, Sunny Chen, and Daniel Gutierrez to complete this Linux OS.

Developed a 32-bit Linux-based kernel using C and x86 Assembly that focused on efficient system calls, kernel privileges, and software context switching. Implemented a Round-Robin scheduler that supports three terminals and manages up to 10 concurrent processes. Wrote device drivers for essential hardware including the keyboard and real-time clock. Established sophisticated paging mechanisms with 4KB and 4MB pages for both kernel and user spaces to optimize memory management and access speeds.
